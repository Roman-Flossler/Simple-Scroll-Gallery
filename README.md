# Story Show Gallery - minimalist, vertical photo gallery, mobile friendly

SSG nicely combines photos and captions to show a whole story in full ­screen, mini­­mal­ist, non-dis­tracting environ­­ment (no ugly arrows). SSG can support your brand and mar­ket­ing. The gallery is vertical - optimized for use on smart­phones.

SSG is also in the form of a [Wordpress plugin](https://ssg.flor.cz/wordpress/)

*Story Show Gallery (on the left) versus usual gallery lightbox. Do you want more icons or more from a photo? SSG can use whole smartphone display - even notch area.*

Story Show Gallery has **very easy setup**, it binds onto image hyper­links on the page auto­mati­cally. You can control this proccess by **CSS classes**. Define sepa­rate galleries, activate full screen mode, selectively deactivate SSG, etc.

## Not another photo gallery

- On smartphones, full screen mode works like on You­Tube. It activa­tes after rotating a phone into landscape mode.
- Brand building (image or text), social sharing icon that can be hardly miss
- Easy browsing without clicking and thinking
- Goo­gle Analytics support 
- Deeplinking
- HTML signpost to other galleries
- No e×it mode for galleries based on bare HTML
- SSG is probably the only gallery which can place each caption individually according to image size vs. screen size:
